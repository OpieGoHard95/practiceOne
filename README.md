CMP237 Practicum for the first practice test

Problem was to make sure that I could skip one line everytime in an array. However, I'm not sure I actually _understand_ the problem. I don't think I did it correctly because instead of __having__ an array of 0 to 10 and then printing out every other number, I am __creating__ a new array and adding every other number from 0 to 10 and then printing that new array which I called numberSkip. I'd like some feedback on my attempt to see if it actually is correct as you dictated it.
